A CHIP-8 emulator written in C# using Monogame for the graphics/input handling.

It ain't pretty, but it can run pong. There are a few other ideas for things I'd like to add (like a memory/instruction viewer) and it could definitely be polished a bit. You can find these things as I identify them in the issues tab.

The test rom I was using is from this repository: https://github.com/corax89/chip8-test-rom
